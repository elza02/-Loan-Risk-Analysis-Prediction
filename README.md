# Loan Risk Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing loan data to assess risk and predict potential loan defaults. The dataset is used to build a predictive model that can identify risky loans based on historical data. The project includes data importing, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning models for prediction.

## Project Structure

The project follows these key steps:

- **Data Analysis**:
  - The initial analysis explores the distribution of loan data, identifying key features that could impact loan defaults.

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - The dataset is cleaned to remove missing values, handle outliers, and preprocess data for modeling.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Features relevant to loan risk prediction are identified and processed.

- **Modeling**:
  - Various machine learning models are applied to predict loan risks, evaluating their performance on test data.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**:
   - The loan dataset is imported from external sources and cleaned to remove irrelevant or erroneous data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The EDA step visualizes the distribution of key features like loan amount, interest rates, and borrower details to understand trends and relationships in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Important features are extracted or transformed to improve the accuracy of the predictive model.
4. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - A machine learning model is trained to predict loan risks. This model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
